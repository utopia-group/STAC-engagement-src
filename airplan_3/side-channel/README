STEP 1:
./active_query.sh

This script measures the response using the 'hacker.txt' route which will gives 
as an upper bound on the size of the response of the user if the route is "Fully 
Connected".

If the response value from the user is larger than this value then the route 
is "Not Fully Connected".

Using this script we can find the upper bound on the size of the response for it 
to be a "Fully Connected" route of 3585. This upper bound occurs when there are 
19 characters used for the fields: (i) connected, (ii) bipartite, (iii) size, 
(iv) density, (v) is 2-connected, (vi) is 3-connected, (vii) is 4-connected and 
(viii) is 5-connected, and 38 characters used for the fields: (i) regular and 
(ii) eulerian.

STEP 2:
./passive_query.sh <filename> <cutoff>

EXAMPLE: ./passive_query.sh connected.txt

Will return that the route 'connected.txt' is 'Fully Connected'

EXAMPLE: ./passive_query.sh not-connected.txt

Will return that the route 'not-connected.txt' is 'Not Fully Connected'

EXAMPLE: ./passive_query.sh hacker.txt

Will return that the route 'hacker.txt' is 'Fully Connected'
