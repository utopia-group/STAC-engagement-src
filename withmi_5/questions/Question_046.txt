Challenge Program:

        withmi_5.jar

Challenge Question:

        Is there a side channel in space in the challenge program from which
        an attacker can determine how many WithMi users are involved in
	a chat which the attacker has not been invited to?

Additional background for question:

	None

Available Operations:

        Passive Operations:     observe the packets generated and timings
                                thereof for a single WithMi session
                                (cost: 1 per observed session)

        Active Operations:      None

        Oracle queries:         query the oracle with a candidate number of 
				users and receive a binary response (yes/no) as 
				to whether the candidate number of users is 
				correct
                                (cost: 1 per query)

Operational Budget:

        Max number of operations : 2 Operations
        Probability of success   : 99%
