Challenge Program:

        withmi_5.jar

Challenge Question:

        Is there a side channel in time in the challenge program from which
        an attacker can determine whether two users (neither of whom is the 
	attacker) in the process of connecting have been previously connected?

Additional background for question:

        For the purpose of this question assume that the attacker observes
	the WithMi session from the start and that the WithMi session being
	observed only contains two users.

Available Operations:

        Passive Operations:     observe the packets generated and timings
                                thereof for a single WithMi session
                                (cost: 1 per observed session)

        Active Operations:      issue a single application request and monitor
                                the induced response traffic for this single
                                request
                                (cost: 1 per request)

        Oracle queries:         none

Operational Budget:

        Max number of operations : 2 Operations
        Probability of success   : 80%
