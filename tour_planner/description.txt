Overview
========
Tour Planner is a web service that allows a user to submit a set
of cities from a prescribed list to the server and receive back
an efficient route that tours these cities. The route, an ordered 
list of the requested cities, is decided upon by the Tour Planner 
algorithm.


Interactions
============
Users can query the Tour Planner server for the list of available 
cities.
./examples/query.sh places

Users can query the Tour Planner server with a list of unique cities 
(from the list of available) and the server will respond with a tour 
starting at the first city in the list.
./examples/query.sh tour <place> <place>...

The example scripts for user interactions are located in the
examples directory.


Engagement Tools
================
The start script (startServer.sh) for the Tour Planner server is 
located in the challenge_program directory.


Notes
=====
The files in the challenge_program directory are used to populate the
Tour Planner server on launch. These files should not be directly 
modified nor should malicious data be directly inserted into them.
