Challenge Program:

	challenge.jar

Challenge Question:

	Is there a side channel in time in the challenge program from which a 
	third party can discover which cities the user would like to visit
	(unordered list)?

Additional background for question:

	For the purpose of the question, assume that the user's query will 
	consist of 5 cities.

Available Operations:

	Passive Operations:	observe the request and corresponding response 
				packets and timings thereof for a single user 
				request 
				(cost: 1 per observed user session)

	Active Operations:	issue a single application request and monitor
                                the induced response traffic for this single
                                request
				(no cost per query)

        Oracle queries:         query the oracle with a candidate user query
                                and receive a binary response (yes/no) as to
                                whether the unordered variant of the candidate
                                query is correct.
                                (cost: 1 per query)

Operational Budget:

	Max number of operations : 300 Operations     
	Probability of success   : 95%
