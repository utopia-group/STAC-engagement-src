Challenge Program:

	challenge.jar

Challenge Question:

	Is there an algorithmic complexity vulnerability in time 
	that would cause the real runtime of the challenge program
	(on the reference platform) to exceed the resource usage 	
	limit given the input budget?

Additional background for question:

	The Tour Planner application can support multiple users. For
        the purpose of this question assume there is only one user
        connected to the Tour Planner server at any one time.

Input Budget:

	Maximum sum of the PDU sizes of the application requests sent from	
	the user to the server: 500 bytes
    
Resource Usage Limit:

	Runtime: 30 seconds measured from the submission of the
	last request to the transmission of the response.
