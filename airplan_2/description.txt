Overview
========
AirPlan is a web application for airlines. It provides the ability to analyze potential 
flight routes.

Airlines can log in to AirPlan to upload route maps. Route maps contain airports and the 
flights between those airports. Flight data, such as the cost of the flight and the number 
of passengers a flight can carry, is also stored. After uploading a route map, an airline 
can perform various analyses on the map. For example, AirPlan can determine the cheapest 
way to get from one airport to another. Saved route maps will be stored even after an 
airline logs out of the system.


Interactions
============
Users can interact with AirPlan using a web browser. Once the AirPlan server is running,
users can navigate to the server at https://localhost:8443. Once logged in, users can 
view any of the stored route maps, upload a new route map, or delete a stored route map.

When a user uploads a new route map, the user will select a file to upload, specify the
weight type of the route map, get the properties list for the route map, and follow each
of the "Next" links until the user arrives back at the AirPlan main page.

Examples of user interactions are provided in the examples directory along with detailed
descriptions of the route map input formats accepted by the AirPlan application 
(Route_Map_Formats.txt).

Engagement Tools
================
The start script (startServer.sh) for the AirPlan server is located in the challenge_program
directory. Once the server is started the script will output "Server started on port 8443"

An example user is provided: Username: usr Password: pwd

The airplan_client.py script provided in the examples directory will allow you to simulate
user interactions.

Notes
=====
The files in the challenge_program directory are used to populate the AirPlan server on launch. 
These files should not be directly modified nor should malicious data be directly inserted into 
them. An attacker would not have access to the files in the challenge_program directory.
