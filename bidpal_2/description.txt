Overview
========
BidPal is a peer-to-peer application that allows users to buy and sell items via a single-round
highest-bidder-wins auction with secret bids.

Interactions
============
Users can launch a BidPal instance by running ./challenge_program/bin/bidpal <port> <username> 
where <port> is the port the program will listen on, and <username> is the name the user will 
be referred to in the auction network. A BidPal run is defined as a single synchronized run
of the BidPal application between a set of BidPal users each running their own instance of the
BidPal application.

User commands:
--------------
connect <host> <port>
	Connect to another BidPal user at the specified host and port.

start <description>	
	Start an auction (as the seller) with the given description for the item. An auction 
	ID will be assigned to the resulting auction.

listauctions		
	Get a list of auctions and their status

status <auction ID>	
	Get the status of the specified auction

bid <auction ID> <amount>	
	Place a bid of the specified amount in the specified auction. At this point the client
	will announce to all other participants of the auction that a bid has been placed by
	this user. After receiving bid information from other clients, any client that believes 
	their bid is the highest will announce it.

close <auction ID>	
	Close bidding on the specified auction. (Can only be performed by the seller)

listbidders <auction ID>	
	List the users who've bid on the specified auction and whether they've claimed to 
	have won the auction.

winner <auction ID> <winner> <winningBid>	
	Announce that you have accepted the winner of the auction ID with the specified bid. 
	(Only the seller can do this, and the specified winner must be the auctual winner -- 
	the seller only has a choice in the event of a tie.)

quit	
	close the program

Typical usage:
--------------
1.  User connects to desired peers.
2.  An auction is announced by a peer.
3.  Interested users bid.
4.  The seller closes the auction.
5.  The seller uses the listbidders command to see who the highest bidder is (or bidders in 
    case of a tie).
6.  The seller announces the winner and the winning bid

Example user interaction scripts are provided in the examples directory.
Note: example script may take up to 5 minutes to complete.

Engagement Tools
================
BidPal requires at least two users running independent BidPal instances simultaneously. 
The example user interaction scripts use the linux utility "expect" to send commands and process 
responses from BidPal. The included Dockerfile, run by the provided challenge program Docker 
registry script, provides a running Docker container with "expect" installed.

Notes
=====
The files in the challenge programs directory are used to provide working example interactions. 
During normal usage each BidPal user would have a separate instance of BidPal running on 
their own system. Malicious data should not be inserted into these files.
