Challenge Program:

	bidpal_2.jar

Challenge Question:

	Is there a side channel in time in the challenge program from which
	an attacker can determine another user's bid to within $30 in the 
	case where that user's bid is not equal to the highest bid?

Additional background for question:

	None

Available Operations:

	Passive Operations:	observe the request and corresponding response 
				packets and timings thereof for a single 
				application request and response between two 
				BidPal users
				(cost: 1 per observed request and corresponding
				response)

	Active Operations:	issue a single application request and monitor
                                the induced response traffic for this single
                                request
				(cost: 1 per request)

	Oracle queries:		query the oracle with a candidate bid for a 
				user and receive a binary response (yes/no) as 
				to whether the candidate bid is within $30 of
				the user's bid
				(cost: 1 per query)

Operational Budget:

	Max number of operations : 2 Operations
	Probability of success   : 75%
