Challenge Program:

        withmi_2.jar

Challenge Question:

        Is there a side channel in space in the challenge program from which
        an attacker can determine which file was transferred from the victim
	user to the participants of a chat that the attacker is not invited to?

Additional background for question:
	
	For the purpose of this question assume that the victim user is on a
        shared machine and that the attacker has access to this machine. The
	victim user will only send the set of files contained within the
	challenge_program/data/files/ directory. The attacker has access to
        this set of files and can view the file contents and metadata.

Available Operations:

        Passive Operations:	observe the packets generated and timings
                                thereof for a single WithMi session
				(cost: 1 per observed session)

        Active Operations:      None

        Oracle queries:         query the oracle with a file and receive a
                                binary response (yes/no) as to whether the
                                candidate file was the file transferred between
				the two WithMi users
                                (cost: 1 per query)

Operational Budget:

        Max number of operations : 2 Operations
        Probability of success   : 99%
