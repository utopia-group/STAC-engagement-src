Challenge Program:

        withmi_2.jar

Challenge Question:

        Is there an algorithmic complexity vulnerability in space
        that would cause the challenge program's memory usage to
	exceed the resource usage limit given the input budget?

Additional background for question:

	The WithMi application can support multiple users. For
        the purpose of this question assume that a single attacker
	is a participant in the network environment defined by
        example_multiuser.sh.

Input Budget:

        Maximum sum of the PDU sizes of the application requests sent from
        the user to the server: 10,000 bytes

Resource Usage Limit:

        Available Memory: 2000 MB (total memory usage of the JVM shown 
	under the RSS column in pmap -x <PID>)
