Challenge Program:

Challenge Question:

	Is there a side channel in time in the challenge program from which 
	a third party can determine the plain text of a message sent between
	two RSA Commander users?

Additional background for question:

	None

Available Operations:

	Passive Operations:	observe the request and corresponding response
                                packets and timings thereof for a single application
                                request and response between two RSA Commander users
				(cost: 1 per observed request and corresponding
                                response)

	Active Operations:	issue a single application request and monitor
                                the induced response traffic for this single
                                request
				(cost: 1 per request)

	Oracle queries:		query the oracle with a candidate plaintext message 
				and receive a binary response (yes/no) as to 
				whether the candidate plaintext message is correct. 
				(cost: 1 per query)

Operational Budget:

	Max number of operations : 10,000 Operations     
	Probability of success   : 80%
