Challenge Program:

        challenge_program.jar

Challenge Question:

        Is there an algorithmic complexity vulnerability in time
        that would cause the real runtime of the challenge program
        (on the reference platform) to exceed the resource usage
        limit given the input budget?

Additional background for question:

	For the purpose of the attack assume the victim user starts
	an instance of the challenge program by running the the
	run_client.sh script in the examples directory. After starting
	the script the victim user performs no other actions.

Input Budget:

        Maximum number of bytes to be sent to the victim RSA 
	Commander application: 5000 bytes

Resource Usage Limit:

        Runtime: 2 hours measured from the submission of the last 
	request to the reception of the automatically generated
	acknowledgement.
