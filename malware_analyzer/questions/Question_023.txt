Challenge Program:

	malware_analyzer.jar

Challenge Question:

	Is there an algorithmic complexity vulnerability in space
        that would cause the challenge program to store a file
        with a logical size that exceeds the resource usage limit
        given the input budget?

Additional background for question:

	The Malware Analyzer application can support multiple users. 
	For the purpose of this question assume there is only one user
	connected to the Malware Analyzer server at any one time.

Input Budget:

	Maximum sum of the PDU sizes of the application requests sent from
	the user to the server: 3000 bytes

Resource Usage Limit:

	Available Logical Size: 80 KB (logical size of outputfile
        measured with 'stat')
