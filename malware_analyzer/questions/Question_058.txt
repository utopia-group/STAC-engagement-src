Challenge Program:

        malware_analyzer.jar

Challenge Question:

        Is there an algorithmic complexity vulnerability in time
        that would cause the real runtime of the challenge program
        (on the reference platform) to exceed the resource usage
        limit given the input budget?

Additional background for question:

	The Malware Analyzer application can support multiple users.
        For the purpose of this question assume there is only one user
        connected to the Malware Analyzer server at any one time.

Input Budget:

	Maximum sum of the PDU sizes of the application requests sent from
        the user to the server: 3000 bytes

Resource Usage Limit:

        Runtime: 30 seconds measured from the submission of the
        last request to the transmission of the response.
