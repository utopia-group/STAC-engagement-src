STEP 1:
Start airplan server

STEP 2:
Generate a route map for the user with n airports and save it in the user.txt file
./user-generator 33 > user.txt

STEP 3:
Use the user response from passenger_capacity_matrix query to determine the number of airports:
./side-channel.sh 

NOTES:
A) We assume that all the airports have 3 characters
B) If you want to try a new user.txt file, then you need to either remove the current map or restart the server

The baseline response for 1 airport with 3 characters was computed using the response-hacker.sh script and has value 3207.
