Challenge Program:

	airplan_5.jar

Challenge Question:

	Is there a side channel in space in the challenge program from which
	an attacker can determine the number of airports in another user's
	stored route map?

Additional background for question:

	For the purpose of this question assume that the airline is a current
        AirPlan user and when the user logs in to AirPlan their first interaction
        will be to upload a route map.

Available Operations:

	Passive Operations:	observe the request and corresponding response 
				packets and timings thereof within a single user 
				session
				(cost: 1 per observed session)

	Active Operations:	issue a single application request and monitor
                                the induced response traffic for this single
                                request
				(cost: 1 per request)

	Oracle queries:		query the oracle with a candidate number of
				airports and receive a binary response (yes/no) 
				as to whether the candidate number of airports
				is correct
				(cost: 1 per query)

Operational Budget:

	Max number of operations : 2 Operations
	Probability of success   : 99%
