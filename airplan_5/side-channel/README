STEP 1:
Start airplan server

STEP 2:
Generate a route map for the user with n airports and save it in to user.txt 
./user-generator.sh 17 > user.txt

STEP 3:
Use the user response from passenger_capacity_matrix query to determine the 
number of airports:
./side-channel.sh 

NOTES:
A) We assume that all the airports have 3 characters
B) If you want to try a new user.txt file, then you need to either remove the 
current map or restart the server

To find the quadratic attack formula we solve the following constraint system:
http://rise4fun.com/Z3/4zypl

To find this formula, we did three observations from the hacker perspective:
i)  We created a route with only 1 airport and query it. Output: 3207
ii) We created a route with onnly 2 airports and query it. Output: 3271
iii) We created a route with onnly 3 airports and query it. Output: 3355

We need three observations to find the constants a, b and c of the quadratic 
formula: a*x^2+b*x+c=n
