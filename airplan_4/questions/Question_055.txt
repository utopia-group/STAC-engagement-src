Challenge Program:

	airplan_4.jar

Challenge Question:

	Is there a side channel in space in the challenge program from which
	an attacker can determine whether directed graph formed by another
	user's route map is strongly connected (for any two airports, A and B, 
	in the route map, there exists a sequence of flights starting at A and 
	ending at B)?

Additional background for question:

	For the purpose of this question assume that the airline is a current
        AirPlan user and when the user logs in to AirPlan their first interaction
        will be to upload a route map.

Available Operations:

	Passive Operations:	observe the request and corresponding response 
				packets and timings thereof within a single user 
				session
				(cost: 1 per observed session)

	Active Operations:	issue a single application request and monitor
                                the induced response traffic for this single
                                request
				(cost: 1 per request)

	Oracle queries:		none

Operational Budget:

	Max number of operations : 2 Operations
	Probability of success   : 99%
