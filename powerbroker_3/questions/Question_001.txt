Challenge Program:

	powerbroker_3.jar

Challenge Question:

	Is there a side channel in time and space in the challenge program 
	from which an attacker, over the course of a full auction, can 
	determine the power generation cost (from their config file) of 
	another seller?

Additional background for question:

	None

Available Operations:

	Passive Operations:     observe the packets generated and timings
                                thereof for a single PowerBroker run
                                (cost: 1 per observed run)

        Active Operations:      issue a single application request and monitor
                                the induced response traffic for this single
                                request
                                (cost: 1 per request)

	Oracle queries:		query the oracle with a candidate power 
				generation cost for a user and receive a 
				binary response (yes/no) as to whether the 
				candidate power generation cost is correct
				(cost: 1 per query)

Operational Budget:

	Max number of operations : 5 Operations
	Probability of success   : 80%
