Overview
========
SmartMail is an email application which allows users to send and receive messages from other 
SmartMail users. The application provides a mailing list functionality. SmartMail mailing 
lists are composed of public subscribers and a special subscriber known as an administrator. 
The addresses of public subsribers is public information, but the addresses of administrators 
are confidential information. Users can query the application for the subscribers of any 
SmartMail mailing list. This will return the addresses of the public subscribers.

Notes
=====
The SmartMail application sits on a common server. Users of the common server can see the size
of SmartMail files but can neither view nor write to them. Users of the common server can install 
and run programs to allow for automated monitoring of the size of SmartMail files.
