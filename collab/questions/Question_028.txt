Challenge Program:

	Collab.jar

Challenge Question:

	Is there a side channel in time in the challenge program from which 
	the user "picard" can discover any eventID relating to one of his
	audits, assuming picard has at least one audit event on his calendar?

Additional background for question:

	User "picard" is not an auditor.

Available Operations:

	Passive Operations:	None

	Active Operations:	issue a single application request and monitor
                                the induced response traffic for this single
                                request
                                (cost: 1 per request)

	Oracle queries:		query the oracle with a candidate audit eventID 
				and receive a binary response (yes/no) as to 
				whether the candidate eventID is the audit 
				eventID for user "picard". 
				(cost: 1 per query)

Operational Budget:

	Max number of operations : 200 Operations     
	Probability of success   : 90%
