Challenge Program:

	Collab.jar

Challenge Question:

	Is there an algorithmic complexity vulnerability in time 
	that would cause the real runtime of the challenge program
	(on the reference platform) to exceed the resource usage 	
	limit given the input budget?

Additional background for question:

	None

Input Budget:

	Maximum sum of the PDU sizes of the application requests sent from
	the user to the server: 100,000 bytes
    
Resource Usage Limit:

	Runtime: 180 seconds measured from the submission of the
	last request to the transmission of the response.
