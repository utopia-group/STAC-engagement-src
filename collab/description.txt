Overview
========
The Collab challenge program is an event scheduling application. The challenge 
program uses the Collab calendar to record a collection of scheduled events. 
Events are stored by eventIDs and each event is associated with a single user.
EventIDs represent the number of time units from an unspecified epoch that an
event will or has taken place. The definitions of epoch and time unit for a 
particular calendar are left up to the calendar's users.

The Collab application contains a special class of users called auditors.
Auditors can schedule special auditing events for other users. The audit events
scheduled by the auditors are invisible to other users. This ensures that the 
targets of said audits do not know when they may be audited.


Interactions
============
Users can use the Collab client to communicate with the Collab server. After
launching the client and signing in, the user's calendar is loaded into a
scheduling sandbox. The scheduling sandbox is a temporary calendar populated
with all of the user's events. The user can proceed to add and remove events
from his/her calendar within the scheduling sandbox. After changes have been
made to a user's calendar within the sandbox, the user can commit the scheduling
sandbox to his/her master calendar, or discard the changes altogether.

- Start Client	  :	- cd into examples directory
			- run startClient.sh

Client Commands
- Login <string: username>  -	Creates a session for user <username>
- SEARCH <int:min, int:max> -	Get a list of eventIDs for the logged in
				user in the interval (<min>, <max>)
- ADD <int:ID>              -	Add a new event with eventID ID to the 
				scheduling sandbox calendar for the logged 
				in user.
- DONE			    -	Commit the scheduling sandbox calendar to 
				the master calendar for the logged in user
				and destroy the scheduling sandbox
- UNDO			    -	Discard the scheduling sandbox calendar 
				without committing its contents to the master
				calendar of the logged in user
- QUIT 			    -	Exit the Collab client application
			  

Engagement Tools
================
The start script (startServer.sh) for the Collab server is located in the 
challenge_program directory.

A user with the username: "picard" has been created for the engagement.
User "picard's" calendar has been pre populated with a number of events.


Notes
=====
The collab.jar can be started in either server or client mode. Only vulnerabilities
that apply to the server mode are considered in scope.
