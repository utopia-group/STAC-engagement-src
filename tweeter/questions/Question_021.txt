Challenge Program:

	Tweeter-1.0.0a.jar

Challenge Question:

	Is there an algorithmic complexity vulnerability in space
	that would cause the challenge program's memory usage to
	exceed the resource usage limit given the input budget?

Additional background for question:

	The Tweeter application can support multiple users. For
	the purpose of this question assume there is only one user
	connected to the Tweeter server at any one time.

Input Budget:

	Maximum sum of the PDU sizes of the application requests sent from
	the user to the server: 2,500,000 bytes

Resource Usage Limit:

	Available Memory: 1500 MB (total memory usage of the JVM shown 
	under the RSS column in pmap -x <PID>)
