Challenge Program:

        Tweeter-1.0.0a.jar

Challenge Question:

        Is there an algorithmic complexity vulnerability in time
        that would cause the real runtime of the challenge program
        (on the reference platform) to exceed the resource usage
        limit given the input budget?

Additional background for question:

	For the purpose of this question assume the attacker is 
	the user with the username "user" and password "password".

	The Tweeter application can support multiple users. For
        the purpose of this question assume there is only one user
        connected to the Tweeter server at any one time.

	The attack must begin after the application is initialized.

Input Budget:

        Maximum sum of the PDU sizes of the application requests sent from
        the user to the server: 2000 bytes

Resource Usage Limit:

        Runtime: 1500 seconds measured from the submission of the
        last request to the transmission of the response.
