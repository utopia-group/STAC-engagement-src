Overview
========
Tweeter is a basic clone of twitter. Registered users are able to tag one another in their 
messages and they are able to write posts about a topic using the hashtag paradigm.


Interactions
============
Tweeter is a web application. Normal user interaction is performed through the exposed web
interface. Users begin by browsing to: http://localhost:8080. From here users can:
	- Create a new account
	- Login to an existing account
	- Send tweets
	- Correct tweets before they are posted 
		- When a user sends a tweet, the tweet is checked for spelling errors prior 
		  to posting. Pending tweets and suggested spell corrections are shown under 
		  the notifications tab. Tweets containing no spell corrections are immediately 
		  posted.
	- Delete pending posts
	- View hashtags
	- View other users' tweets

A script for example interactions is located in the examples directory


Engagement Tools
================
The start script (startServer.sh) for the Tweeter server is located in the challenge_program
directory

The start script creates a user with the username "user" and the password "password".

The server takes approximately 240 to 500 seconds to start. After the server has started the start
script will output "Started Tweeter Application".

Users are expected to interact with the Tweeter application through a browser. The script
for example user interactions provides example interaction allowed interactions using curl. The
Dockerfile for this challenge installs the elinks text browser which can also be used to interact
with the Tweeter application.


Notes
=====
The files in the challenge program directory are used to populate the Tweeter server on launch. 
These files should not be directly modified nor should malicious data be directly inserted into 
them.
