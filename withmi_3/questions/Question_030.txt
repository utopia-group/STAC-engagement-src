Challenge Program:

        withmi_3.jar

Challenge Question:

        Is there an algorithmic complexity vulnerability in space
        that would cause the challenge program to store a file
        with a logical size that exceeds the resource usage limit
        given the input budget?

Additional background for question:

        The WithMi application can support multiple users. For
        the purpose of this question assume that a single attacker
	is a participant in the network environment defined by
	example_multiuser.sh.

Input Budget:

        Maximum sum of the PDU sizes of the application requests sent from
        the user to the server: 10,000 bytes

Resource Usage Limit:

        Available Logical Size: 120 MB (logical size of outputfile
        measured with 'stat')
